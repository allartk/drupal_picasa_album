I wrote this drupal 7 module for a  association with limited storage on their host. This module does not
store any of the picasa data such as thumbnails on your host (in contrast to e.g. brilliant gallery)).

The module shows public picasa albums from a single user on your site.
Currently it provides a page with thumbnails and a block with album titles. A page with
photos from a album will be added soon.

Install this module just like any other module in sites/all/modules.
